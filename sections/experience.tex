\subsection{{Senior Advisor~~|~~Advanced Analytics \& Data Sciences~~|~~Manufacturing \& Supply Chain \hfill 2022-Present}}
\subtext{Eli Lilly \& Company \hfill Indianapolis, IN}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Built end-to-end supply chain optimization platform for \$13B+ incretin portfolio (Mounjaro, Zepbound, Trulicity) using Python/Pyomo with Streamlit frontend deployed on Kubernetes, enabling real-time decision support for global orchestration teams.
\item Increased manufacturing capacity by 5M devices annually through ML-driven production line optimization, including dynamic time warping for root-cause downtime analysis {\color{customcolor} (patent pending)} and Bayesian anomaly detection {\color{customcolor} (patent pending)}.
\item Designed physics-informed simulation framework combining ODEs with real fault data to optimize conveyor layouts {\color{customcolor} (patent pending)}, driving \$2M+ infrastructure investments that unlocked 1.5M additional devices annually.
\item Developed neural ODE models in PyTorch for pharmacodynamic forecasting, improving predictions for insulin-glucose dynamics and biologics response using clinical trial data.
\item Scaled team effectiveness by mentoring 2 PhD interns, creating technical onboarding framework (Git workflows, documentation standards), and accelerating 4 new hire integrations.
